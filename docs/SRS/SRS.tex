\section{Purpose of the Project}
This project aims to provide a system that will reduce the amount of time radiologists and medical professionals will need to spend reviewing chest x-rays of patients. Users of the completed solution proposed in this project will be able to upload a chest x-ray and receive a generated diagnostic radiology report outlining any abnormalities in the given image.

\subsection{User Business}
The user businesses are medical institutions (e.g. hospitals) and other medical imaging businesses (e.g. diagnostic centres). These businesses aim to review and analyze patient chest x-rays, perform diagnostics, report their findings and present the results to their patients and/or relevant third parties as soon as possible. 

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The primary goal of the project is to provide accurate detection of abnormality given an x-ray image and generate a diagnostic radiology report outlining any abnormalities. The project's other goals are to provide secure and remote access to the system while having an intuitive user interface. A further stretch goal of the project is to be able to generate structured or free-formed radiology diagnostic reports using natural language processing (NLP).
