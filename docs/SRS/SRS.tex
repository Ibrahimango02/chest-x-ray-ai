\noindent This document describes the requirements for the AI for Chest X-Ray Read. The template for the
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.
Sections 1-5 (with all their subsections) in the original template were combined into the new \textbf{Project Drivers} section. \\

\noindent Sections 6-9 (with all their subsections) in the original template were combined into the new \textbf{Functional requirements} section, with a new \textbf{Traceability Matrix} subsubsection and a new \textbf{Formal Specification for the ML Algorithm} subsection added in.
Sections 10-17 (with all their subsections) in the original template were combined into the new \textbf{Non-functional requirements} section. Sections 18-26 (with all their subsections) in the original template were combined into the new \textbf{Project Issues} section. A new section, \textbf{Appendix}, was added.

\section{Project Drivers}
This section covers the various drivers of this project, including the purpose of the project, the various stakeholders, the various mandated constraints, naming conventions and terminology, and relevant facts and assumptions.

\subsection{Purpose of the Project}
This project aims to provide a system that will reduce the amount of time radiologists and medical professionals will need to spend reviewing chest X-rays of patients. Users of the completed solution proposed in this project will be able to upload a chest x-ray and receive a generated diagnostic radiology report outlining any abnormalities in the given image.

\subsubsection{User Business}
The user businesses are medical institutions (e.g. hospitals) and other medical imaging businesses (e.g. diagnostic centres). These businesses aim to review and analyze patient chest X-rays, perform diagnostics, report their findings and present the results to their patients and/or relevant third parties as soon as possible. 

\subsubsection{Goals of the Project}
The primary goal of the project is to provide accurate detection of abnormality given an x-ray image and generate a diagnostic radiology report outlining any abnormalities. The project's other goals are to provide secure and remote access to the system while having an intuitive user interface. A further stretch goal of the project is to be able to generate structured or free-formed radiology diagnostic reports using natural language processing (NLP).

\subsection{Formal Specification for the ML Algorithm}
This subsection details the formal specification for the machine learning algorithm.
The machine learning algorithm can be considered a function (\textit{f}).
The primary output would be to detect \textit{n} different types of diseases.
\begin{gather*}
    f:Image \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \\
    f(I) = \{x_i | x_i \in \mathbb{R}; i, n \in \mathbb{N} | 0 \le x_i \le 1, 1 \le i \le n\}
\end{gather*}
 
\noindent Where the input domain is an x-ray image and the output codomain of the function is a vector with \textit{n} dimensions.
Each real number in the vector represents the probability of having a certain disease. 
The report created needs to have a definite prediction (1 or 0) for each disease. The prediction vector is based on whether the probability is above a threshold.  
Suppose each disease has a threshold ($t_i$) for deciding whether the disease is present: 
\begin{align*}
    t_i: \mathbb{R}, 0 \le t_i \le 1, 1 \le i \le n
\end{align*}

\noindent Then the vector constituting the predictions is:
\begin{gather*}
    predictions: \{0,1\}^n \\
    predictions = \Biggl\{ p_i \big| p_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}; i, n, \in \mathbb{N}; x_i \in f(I) \big| 1 \le i \le n, p_i =
    \begin{cases}
        0 & x_i < t_i \\
        1 & x_i \ge t_i
    \end{cases}
    \Biggr\}
\end{gather*}

\subsection{Costs}
There are no costs anticipated with this project, however should any purchases be necessary the total will not exceed \$750.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
This subsection contains the details of all needed user documentation and training for this project's proposed solution.

\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
The system will have the following documentation provided to the users:
\begin{description}
    \item[User Interface:] The system will have a guide outlining the use of each section of the UI and accepted forms on data that can be uploaded to the system.  
    \item[Model:] The model is more complex and will come with details pertaining to the accuracy of detection, which diseases the system can identify, the policy of storing and keeping information, and maintenance and updates.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
There will be no training requirements.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Reflection}
The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain-specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, writing,
  presentation, team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
